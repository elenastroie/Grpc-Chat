# Grpc-Chat
 
A simple chat server/client implemented with gRPC in C# me and my teammates made in the second semester of our second year of college.

The chat comes with text formatting as shown below. We also included an easter egg that goes hand in hand with our unique design of the chat (specified below) . 

!Updating the NuGet Packages may be required for the project to work.

Entering one of the following names into the chat will start/stop a specific song that belongs to that singer :
* Guta
* Piticu
* Salam
* Minune
